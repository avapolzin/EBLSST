I want to allow multiple TRILEGAL downloads simultaneously.  I beleive this would require separate folders.  This is almost set up in vespa, but it needs to carry through to the perl script.  I will modify those here, and point to these specifically when running the new code.

cp ~/anaconda/envs/py36/bin/get_trilegal .
cp ~/anaconda/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/vespa/stars/trilegal.py .

Within trilegal.py:
-- I added one more argument to be sent to get_trilegal = the folder name
-- I also added the path to the extinction (part of vespa.stars)

Within get_trilegal:
-- I prepended that folder name to lixo and tmpfile
